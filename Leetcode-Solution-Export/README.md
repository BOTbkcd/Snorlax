# Leetcode-Solution-Export


### Steps Involved:
- Provide login credentials
- Provide link to the first problem page from where to start
- First attempt at saving a solution page requires some extra steps (these steps have to performed once & these changes will persist for subsequent downloads):
     - Code Editor block on the right side of the page is removed since it is redundant
     - Drag the left block containing solution to full width
     - Select save options for the page (save as single page in my case)
          - Chrome had this strange bug where first attempt at saving a webpage as a single file simply saves the page as html but further attempts work fine.
- Move to the next question
